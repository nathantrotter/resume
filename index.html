                        <h5>Home Automation</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dear faculty, I undersand that this website of mine is very basic and lack luster. In reality, the only reason I even made it is so that I can tell you a bit more about my personal hobbies that I was unable to include in my essay due to word limitations. When I was a young teenager in South Dakota, we built a home that incorporated a significant amount of automation technology. While in the building process, I helped my father wire thousands of cables including CAT 5, coax, HDMI, speaker wire etc., to just about every location in the home. All the wires funneled into a single room with 2 massive server racks containing controllers, amps, receivers, terabytes of NAS storage and much more. This began my fascination with home automation. As a brand-new homeowner, I was set on making my home as “smart” as possible, though at a fraction of my parents budget. I chose (for now) to host all my controls and automations using Apple HomeKit. One large pitfall to using HomeKit is that there are many quality sensors and devices on the market that use z-wave or zigbee protocol that are not compatible. Fortunately, I found a solution. I decided to purchase a mini-pc to use as a home server that I currently have running Ubuntu. I deployed two containers on docker using portainer, one container running an open-source software called home bridge and the other running a video integrations platform called scrypted. Using homebridge and its community-built plugins, I can now add z-wave and zigbee devices to HomeKit that would otherwise be incompatible. I currently have 5 security cameras that are wired PoE to a local NVR…I wasn’t a fan of those subscription, cloud-based security systems. Scrypted exposes my “incompatible” RTSP cameras to HomeKit and even supports "smart" detections from cameras, like packages, animals, people, and faces as contact sensors within HomeKit which allows me to create more advanced automations. I now have almost 150 different switches/devices/ hubs/ and sensors on my network creating a home more capable, stable and secure than my parents’ home… all completed at less than 100th the cost. Amazing what 15 years of innovation can do. </li>
